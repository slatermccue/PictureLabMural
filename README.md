# Picture Lab Mural
using APCSA's Picture Lab to build a paint-by-number mural

## school Maker Faire March 2024

Note: We had the last minute idea to record the operation.  My phone ran out of battery after a couple hours.
The final picture is our school mascot, an eagle, perched on top of the Maker Faire robot with the
words Maker Faire 2024 in the upper right.

We used a large format poster printer to print two 24" x 96" posters that were taped together.  This was then
taped to a cheap 4x8 sheet of plywood.  We mounted the plywood to a large monitor stand and put it as low as possible
so the smaller attendees could still contribute.  Adults may have had to stoop a bit, but overall the project was well received.

Users were shown a palette of 1" foam brushes and numbered paints, and told to paint up to ten non-contiguous squares.
You can see that early users did a good job of keeping to the rule of not painting contiguous squares, but later
ones did not.  This is most likely due to the fact the students were very busy answering general questions and talking about
their robot, a Romi robot from Pololu.  The end result was a bit janky because we transposed a couple lids of paint.  We numbered the
lids and not the bottles, so pink and brown got switched somewhere along the way.

The end result was a lot of fun.  Passers-by did not mind a bit lending a hand, and they came back occasionally to see what progress
had been made.  Prior to the Maker Faire, a test image was done by the class.  It took us three class periods to paint, so we were sure we'd be able
to get it painted during the 3 or 4 hour window of the Maker Faire.
